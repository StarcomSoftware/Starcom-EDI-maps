Authentication Key Name^
^
Name of the key used for authentication; this name is
mutually known to the security originator and the security
recipient, is unique for this relationship, and is intended 
to allow the changing of the key from time to time 
Note: The special key name "0123456789ABCDEF" is reserved 
for the hexadecimal value 0123456789ABCDEF (i.e. a 
fixed non-secret value) to provide a well-known 
value for data integrity testing only)

Encryption Key Name^
^
Name of the key used for encryption; this name is mutually
known to the security originator and the security recipient,
is unique for this relationship, and is intended to allow the
changing of the key from time to time Note: If any of the optional 
fields are present, the Key Name should contain either "PUBLIC"
if a public key is being used to encrypt the one-time key or 
the actual name of the asymmetric key-encrypting-key used to
encrypt the one-time key. 

@
|994
Encryption Service Code^
^
Coded values representing options for encryption processing,
including the use of compression and filtering; the code either
defines the encryption mode and the transmission filter
specification for filtering binary data into transmittable text
or specifics that the following subelements define these values 

:20: ANSI X9.23 Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), No Filter (Binary Cipher Text)
:21: ANSI X9.23 Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Hexadecimal Filter
:22: ANSI X9.23 Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), ASCII Filter

:AA: Parameters Defined Individually
:ZZ: Mutually Defined

Length of Data^
^
Length of data is the no. of character positions of the compressed
or encrypted/filtered text; when data is plain text, this field 
shall be absent 

@
|996
Initialization Vector^
^
The archival representation of a value expressed in hexadecimal notation
as ASCII characters from the set of characters (0..9, A..F); the value is
used as a starting point for encryption of a data sequence to increase 
 security by introducing cryptographic variance and to synchronize 
cryptographic equip; a new Initialization Vector (IV) shall be used for
each message; the IV shall not be intentionally reused; the binary value,
not its ASCII representation, is used for the cryptographic process; in
the interchange process, the resultant encrypted and filtered IV is sent;
the hexadecimal notation is the representation for archiving purposes; the
IV shall be a random or pseudo-random no. 

@
|997
Hash or Authentication Code^
^
The message authentication code or hash/digest generated by the
authentication process; when the Data Encryption Standard (DES) 
algorithm is used, the field consists of 4 hexadecimal coded
characters (i.e., characters from the set 0..9, A..F), a separator
character (space, "-", or other), and 4 hexadecimally coded
characters; when non-DES hashes are used, the result of the hash
is expressed as hexadecimally coded characters without spaces;
when authentication or hash is not used, this field should be filled
with a non-blank character other than the set (0..9, A..F) for the 
minimum length

Note: X9 has a required minimum length of 4 characters for a
security originator; no mechanism, or registration method, is 
provided by X9 or X12 to guarantee uniqueness of the identifier 

@
|1436
Assurance Recipient^
^
Unique designation (identity) of the cryptographic process that
performs validation of the stated assurance on received data. In 
the absence of an Assurance Recipient all potential receivers will often 
be able to validate the assurance because the cryptographic technique is 
based on a "public" (as opposed to "secret") technology Note: X9 has
required minimum length of 4 characters for a security recipient; 
no mechanism, or registration method, is provided by X9 or X12 to
guarantee uniqueness of the identifier 

@

format (00..23), NN = minutes of the hour (00-59), SS = second of hour 
(00..59), TTT = [optional] milli-seconds (000..999), ZZZ = [optional]
three character, nominal timezone indicator (including daylight 
savings time indicator) and XXXXX = 3-5 digit (including leading + or - 
 sign) offset of time to universal time, with three position format
indicating hours-offset for whole hours, and five position format 
 indicating hours and minutes offset where this is necessary. For example: 
1993061522133OCDT+0930 which represents 15 June 1993, 22:13 (10:13pm),
Central Daylight Time (Nominal Value "CDT"), in a timezone that is
